        Problem
      </h2>
      <p class="partial-width">
        Health research has long been considered solely an academic pursuit, and it’s extremely common for researchers
        to conduct their experiments without the contributions and feedback of the greater communities they study. This
        makes for both bad relationships and bad science.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        Thankfully, a new research approach is starting to gain traction. Community-engaged research (CEnR) is a
        philosophy and set of research methods that aim to <strong>bring community partners into the research
          process</strong>, at any point from study design and implementation to analysis and dissemination.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        However, since the approach is so new, there is very little infrastructure in place to help it take root and
        thrive.

        We partnered with the MICHR Community Engagement (CE) team for this work. The CE team’s overarching goal is to
        foster academic and community relationships for CEnR in all phases of the research process, but we wanted to
        focus our project on just one segment: the act of finding and creating connections.

        User Interviews

      <p class="partial-width">
        We conducted a series of interviews with both users from our key audience segment, as well as expert interviews
        from other organizations that had tackled similar challenges before.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        We chose 7 interviews to analyze with an <strong>affinity map</strong>, consisting of 3 community organization
        members and 4 academics at U-M.
      </p>

      <h5 class="partial-width mreach">
        Interview Highlights
      </h5>
      <ul class="partial-width">
        <li>
          We invited CE team members to the calls, which <strong>exposed them directly to their users</strong>. In
          addition to giving them context for our subsequent design decisions, it gave us the power of their buy-in.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thankfully the CE team had strong connections to their users, and we were able to interview people from
          different backgrounds. Having a <strong>diversity of users</strong> for interviews gave us a strong foundation
          for knowing what to build in later phases.
        </li>
        <li>
          By the end, we began to hear consistent things from each interviewee. Of course, each person’s specific
          experience would change, but seeing so much <strong>overlap in the comments and sentiment</strong> is what
          signaled to us that we had done enough interviews. </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="partial-width mreach">
        Interview Challenges
      </h5>
      <ul class="partial-width">
        <li>
          Although the CE team had strong ties to the community, it was challenging to <strong>find the right people to
            interview</strong>—especially on the academic side where the team’s relationships were weaker.
        </li>
        <li>
          It was a real benefit to have much of the CE team listen in on the interviews, but trying to
          <strong>coordinate with so many people’s schedules</strong> became cumbersome for the interview process and
          ultimately slowed the speed of our data collection.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final themes did not represent every single insight. As is the question with all user research artifacts,
          <strong>how do you make sure you’re capturing everything you need to</strong>?

        User Co-Creation Session
      </h3>
      <p class="partial-width">
        The CE team held an annual retreat that would bring together 80 of our core users, and we did not want to pass
        up this opportunity to learn directly from them.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        We split our 75-minute session into 3 parts, each one giving us valuable takeaways for our user research:
      </p>
      <ol class="partial-width">
        <li>Share stories and challenges</li>
        <li>Brainstorm solutions</li>
        <li>Build something!</li>
      </ol>

      <h4 class="partial-width">
        Part 1: Share CEnR experiences, particularly noticing the challenges on the story chart
      </h4>
      <p class="partial-width">
        By sharing stories with each other, each group built shared context. Sharing their challenges gave people an
        outlet for their frustrations and set them up to create solutions in the next part of the session.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        <strong>Our research takeaways</strong>: user narratives to pull from in our analysis.

        Part 2: Use post-its to brainstorm ideas for solutions to those challenges
      </h4>
      <p class="partial-width">
        In a rapid brainstorming session, each group member used sticky notes to generate a series of ideas to address
        the challenges brought up in the story. By first giving each participant individual time to write down ideas
        before sharing them all with a group, there was space for both independent reflection and group synthesis.

      <p class="partial-width">

        After a series of solutions had been brainstormed, we revealed a table of craft supplies. Each group picked an
        idea and built a model of it out of materials like construction paper, pipe cleaner, glass bottles, and yarn.
        This part got people the most excited and engaged with the session, and we got an endless variety of creative
        solutions.

        Co-Creation Highlights
      </h5>
      <ul class="partial-width">
        <li>
          The session itself was tons of fun! People really enjoyed creating with their hands, and we gained
          <strong>substantial buy-in</strong> from our users for our project. (Over 20 people of the 80 attending
          indicated they’d be interested in helping with the project.)
        </li>
        <li>
          We gained a deeper understanding of <strong>not just what the users said they want, but what they were
            committed to enough to build</strong>. (One group created a match.com-like website that became a huge source
          of inspiration in our prototyping phase.)
        </li>
        <li>
          People <strong>solved for problems all along stages of the CEnR process</strong>, helping us gain a
          comprehensive picture of
          the landscape and see more gaps that we could fill.
      </ul>
      <h5 class="partial-width mreach">
        Co-Creation Challenges
      </h5>
      <ul class="partial-width">
        <li>
          It was <strong>difficult to capture all of the co-creation artifacts</strong>. We took as many photos and
          videos as possible
          to capture the process, but because we didn’t have enough time for everyone to share, a lot of insight was
          lost.
        </li>
        <li>
          We only had 75 minutes, and each part felt rushed. Part of that was hard to work around since we had a
          <strong>limited time slot</strong> within another team’s greater event. But we could have been more strategic
          about the
          allocation of time to each part.
        </li>
        <li>
          We gave too many instructions verbally, and people often missed small details that we would have to repeat.
          For future sessions, <strong>we will make instructions available visually</strong> so people can easily follow
          along.

        Knowing we needed to tackle just a slice of the entire CEnR process for our first prototype, we chose to focus
        on two key domains of opportunity: <strong>matching partners</strong> and <strong>defining a project</strong>.
        These are the two use cases we
        wanted to attempt to solve for first.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        Focusing on the matching piece, we decided to center our first prototype around matching. Our core app
        functionality would be to make pairings between community members and academics, and after these matches were
        made we would offer friendly suggestions for how to most effectively form a partnership.

        a matching service, and a chatbot.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        We decided to bring the models to life through the use of paper prototypes. Using this method, we presented a
        minimum level of fidelity in order to signal to our users that we are in the very beginning stages of forming a
        product. We wanted users to feel unrestrained to give their feedback, unfiltered by intimidating visual design.

      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        The wireframes allowed us to more deeply explore what it would look like to make connections in the CEnR space,
        considering the many differences among the two audiences of community members and academics.

        User Testing
      </h3>
      <p class="partial-width">
        At this point, the COVID-19 pandemic had shaken the world, and we were limited in our round of testing, both
        with how many users we could recruit as well as the nature of those sessions.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        We therefore held a short round of user feedback for 3 users, exposing them to the wireframes for the key
        features of the networking app: finding connections, seeing their profile pages, and reaching out.

      <p class="partial-width">
        Our short testing session still proved fruitful, as we identified major areas we could improve upon:
      </p>

      <ol class="partial-width">
        <li>People need support in <strong>all phases of the CEnR journey</strong>, not just the piece about finding a
          partner.</li>
        <li>People want a place they can reliably turn to for <strong>any CEnR need</strong>, or to point new people to.
        </li>
        <li>People often need <strong>tailored resources</strong> and want a more direct line to the MICHR CE team.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5 class="partial-width mreach">
        Pivot
      </h5>
      <p class="partial-width">
        We realized we needed to <strong>expand our scope</strong> and consider adding other elements to the platform such
        as resources and
        events. We needed to create a <strong>more comprehensive space for all CEnR needs</strong>, broadening both the
        offerings and the
        relevance of the platform.

        team to establish a rough service blueprint.

      <p class="partial-width">
        We wanted to show the different user touchpoints with the website and its automated emails, while also
        emphasizing the CE Team touchpoints with people if they were in certain stages states within the user journey.

        To think through the details of implementation, we created a thorough review of the platform and created a list
        of user stories to enumerate what we needed to design.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        Creating the list in AirTable allowed us to use the list as a Kanban board to track progress during the
        development stage.

        Events and resources were the biggest additions, and we also wanted to create a home dashboard to create a

        UI Design

        Using atomic design principles, I created my designs by establishing the pattern for atoms, molecules,
        organisms, templates, and pages.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        Because I knew upfront that I would be developing our prototype application in Bubble, I would alternate between
        designing in Sketch and designing in Bubble. Gaining a deep understanding early on about the ways Bubble handed
        its UI (as well as its very many limitations) helped me keep the designs realistic and polished, while speeding
        up front-end development time.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        The UI of key pages and elements are seen below.

        No-Code Development

        We built this application through Bubble.io, a no-code platform that allows people to build full applications
        without writing (much) code.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        To gain a better understanding of the underlying structure, we prepared certain assets for development including
        a site map and back-end data model. We used Whimsical to keep these flexible enough so they could change as we
        continued to iterate on the protoype in the future.
      </p>

        class="image-full-width">
      <p class="partial-width">
        We then used the Bubble editor to implement the front-end UI and create the back-end flows. We hired a student
        intern to help with hooking up the workflows and working out the logic for various components of the site.
      </p>
      <p class="partial-width">
        The most challenging parts of programming came with the connection matching criteria, as well as hooking up the
        back-end processing for email digests and email verification flows.
