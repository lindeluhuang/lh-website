                        was a fun, low-stakes way
                        for me to dig deeper into the medium of software. As simple as it was, this app gave me
                        invaluable

                    I created a Wishing Wall where people can anonymously post a wish and interact with other people’s
                    wishes. This simple app allows users to:

                    Since this was my first project using React, I was mostly trying to learn the basics of React
                    structures
                    with components, state, props and all that good stuff. After creating the basic outline for my app,
                    I
                    ran into challenges with my project that called me to look to external libraries for specific
                    solutions:

                <ul class="partial-width">
                    <li><strong>React Router</strong>
                        <br>Since I wanted a seamless way to navigate through the app, I implemented React Router to
                        manage
                        content transitions.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Redux</strong>
                        <br>To manage state globally, I looked to Redux to create a scalable framework for loading,
                        storing,
                        and changing data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redux-Thunk</strong>
                        <br>I used Thunk as a middleware platform to manage actions going into the Redux store. </li>

                    Lessons Learned
                </h2>
                <p class="partial-width">
                    This simple app let me flex my JavaScript muscles through React, seeing an actual product come to
                    life!
                    It helps me <strong>appreciate the work that goes into coding the designs I create</strong>, both
                    from a
                    technical and experiential perspective.
                </p>
                <p class="partial-width">
                    On the technical side, I learned a lot about the <strong>React library and some common
                        integrations</strong>. I built components, passed down props, and set up a Redux store to enable
                    scalable app interactivity. Though I know I’ve just skimmed the surface, I built up a foundation I
                    can
                    easily build off of as I start to build more complicated apps.
                </p>
                <p class="partial-width">
                    And on the experience side, it was quite the ride. I <strong>got a taste of some development
                        pains</strong>, from setting up the project to thinking through logic flows to refactoring over
                    and
                    over again. And of course debugging, oh the profound pain of debugging!!!
                </p>
                <p class="partial-width">
                    But <strong>boy was it satisfying</strong> being able to see my app working and know I built it all
                    myself. (With the help of many, many people contributing to open source code, of course.)
                    Creating something with actual functionality is
                    quite the rush, and indeed rather addicting!
                </p>
                <p class="partial-width">
                    My next step is to integrate with a back-end database so the Wishing Wall can truly come to life.
                    Stay
                    tuned!
