                        Problem
                    </h2>
                    <p class="partial-width">When I joined Lantern, our main focus was to help people plan ahead for end-of-life. This idea was so radical and provocative that thousands of people per month saw the marketing pages and signed up for accounts. However, <strong>users didn’t actually do anything once they logged on</strong>. It seemed that the product itself was not living up to what these users (whom we called “pre-planners”) wanted. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="partial-width">The goals of this project were to:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li>Understand how people thought about a pre-plan, uncovering their needs, wants, and pain points</li>
                        <li>Redesign the pre-planning product so it delivers what people really want</li>

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        Since this was the first time anyone had done user research on the pre-planner population, we decided we needed two rounds of user interviews. The first round would be broad, teaching us where to narrow in and focus for the second round.

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        During the first round of user interviews, we tried to understand <strong>how people thought about and navigated the end-of-life space in general</strong>, without emphasizing the role of a single product like Lantern. It featured questions such as: 
                    </p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li>When was the first time you thought about end of life planning?</li>

                        <li>Have you had end of life conversations with people around you? Tell me about a recent conversation.</li>
                        <li>This may be an uncomfortable question and you are completely welcome to not answer it, but have you had an experience losing someone close to you? Do you think that has that impacted the way you think about end of life? How so?</li>

                        User Interviews: Round 2
                    </h3>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        The first round of user interviews taught us that people who were interested in exploring the end-of-life space often didn’t know where to start or what they should be thinking about. They felt lost and overwhelmed. When considering a product like Lantern, above all they craved guidance and a sense of empowerment for each increment of progress.
                    </p>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        For the second round of interviews, we followed that thread and probed more deeply on <strong>what sort of guidance would feel helpful yet still approachable</strong>. We incorporated more activities with users, such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li>Product walkthroughs, learning how people respond to different aspects of the existing site</li>
                        <li>Card sorts, learning how people conceptualize tasks fitting into categories</li>
                        <li>Layout comparisons, learning how people respond to different formats on how tasks are presented</li>

                    </h3>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        The team had been operating under the assumption that people planning ahead wanted similar things from a product as people who were managing a loss. The user interview sessions revealed some surprising and insightful insights, underscoring that these are two completely separate populations. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        Certain characteristics made the pre-planning scenario particularly unique:</p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li>
                            Unlike a scenario where someone is managing a loss (“after-loss”), there is little urgency with pre-planning. Barriers such as anxiety and fear around the subject of death as well as confusion about what actually needs to get done, combined with people’s natural laziness and a feeling like death isn’t imminent, create an <strong>easy case for procrastination</strong>. People think planning ahead for death is important, just not right now. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once people begin pre-planning with Lantern, they realize how many things there are that they've never thought about. They find the structure helpful to learn more to satisfy their curiosity, and yet, many of them <strong>look around but don't actually fill things out or check things off</strong> because:
                            <ul class="partial-width">
                                <li>It's <strong>too much effort</strong> to get their documents and accounts</li>
                                <li>It's <strong>an emotional experience</strong> to engage with all the topics</li>
                                <li>Some topics they <strong>don't really care</strong> about</li>
                                <li>There are some things they want to talk to people about, but it's <strong>hard to think about starting conversations</strong> because the topic is so taboo</li>
                                <li>They’re <strong>not sure of their answers</strong>; It's just hard to make decisions</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>People who do fill out their pre-plan don’t always think about it like they’re “preparing for death,” rather <strong>they see it as a “responsible” thing to do</strong>. It’s like “getting their ducks in a row” or “getting prepared.” Just another thing to manage as a responsible adult. </li>

                        Using the information we collected with our research summary, we created a set of personas to represent the 4 archetypes of users we observed. These archetype users emerged from their preferences with regard to 2 critical questions:

                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li>How <strong>urgent and relevant</strong> is it to the user to plan ahead?</li>
                        <li>How <strong>comfortable</strong> are they with <strong>confronting the idea of death</strong>?</li>

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        It became clear that the key audience we wanted to target was the lower-right quadrant: <strong>users who were fairly comfortable thinking about death, but did not find the planning to be urgent</strong>. We elaborated on this person and called her <strong>Adulting Amy</strong>. Her main motivation in thinking about end-of-life is to get organized and plan ahead, like a responsible adult.

                        After exploring different concepts on paper, we moved to Figma to map out the most promising variations of what the main task flow could look like for the purpose of <strong>testing different versions with users</strong>. We focused on the act of actually filling out responses, which would be the heart of the app.

                        <ul class="partial-width">
                            <li>People like seeing <strong>just one question at a time</strong>. It makes them feel like they can focus on a single task, rather than getting overwhelmed by seeing the seemingly endless overall list of tasks.</li>
                            <li>People really loved having <strong>multiple-choice options</strong> and seeing <strong>sample answers</strong>. For many types of questions (for example about planning a funeral), most people had no idea what was standard or even possible, so having existing choices provided helpful markers and guardrails. </li>
                            <li>People wanted the option to <strong>skip an answer</strong>, or to mark something as an “I don’t have a preference” if they really didn’t have an opinion on the question.</li>

                        Using Heap and our other internal data tools, we were able to track engagement with our new pre-plan. We saw <strong>the number of people who engaged with a pre-planning task went from around 12-25% in Q2 to 60% in Q4</strong>, a whopping <strong>5x increase</strong>! We also saw <strong>monthly repeat visits rise from 1.02 to 2.47, increasing by 2.5x</strong>! The data showed that the redesign yielded considerable growth and progress.

                        The redesign of the pre-planning experience was a major milestone in the Lantern compnay journey. As <strong>the first project that incorporated user feedback into the pre-planner experience</strong>, it was pivotal to set foundational knowledge around this user group and be much more effective in catering to their needs.

                    <p class="partial-width">
                    It is clear from the data, both the engagement numbers and testimonials, that <strong>we improved metrics in all categories</strong> and we’ve really struck something special with our new design. Here’s to making it even better with the projects to come!

                        A <strong>big thank you to Alyssa and Shae and the whole team that made it happen</strong>! It makes my heart happy to know that with this increased engagement, more people will leave far more information for their loved ones after they pass, leading to a much greater sense of ease and reduced burden when they need it most.
