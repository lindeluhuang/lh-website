                        Problem
                    </h2>
                    <p class="partial-width">When I joined Lantern, our main focus was to help people plan ahead for end-of-life. This idea was so radical and provocative that thousands of people per month saw the marketing pages and signed up for accounts. However, <strong>users didn’t actually do anything once they logged on</strong>. It seemed that the product itself was not living up to what these users (whom we called “pre-planners”) wanted. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="partial-width">The goals of this project were to:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li>Understand how people thought about a pre-plan, uncovering their needs, wants, and pain points</li>
                        <li>Redesign the pre-planning product so it delivers what people really want</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        Since this was the first time anyone had done user research on the pre-planner population, we decided we needed two rounds of user interviews. The first round would be broad, teaching us where to narrow in and focus for the second round.

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        During the first round of user interviews, we tried to understand <strong>how people thought about and navigated the end-of-life space in general</strong>, without emphasizing the role of a single product like Lantern. It featured questions such as: 
                    </p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li>When was the first time you thought about end of life planning?</li>
                        <li>Why do you want to plan? How does it help you?</li>
                        <li>Have you had end of life conversations with people around you? Tell me about a recent conversation.</li>
                        <li>This may be an uncomfortable question and you are completely welcome to not answer it, but have you had an experience losing someone close to you? Do you think that has that impacted the way you think about end of life? How so?</li>
                    </ul>

                        User Interviews: Round 2
                    </h3>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        The first round of user interviews taught us that people who were interested in exploring the end-of-life space often didn’t know where to start or what they should be thinking about. They felt lost and overwhelmed. When considering a product like Lantern, above all they craved guidance and a sense of empowerment for each increment of progress.
                    </p>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        For the second round of interviews, we followed that thread and probed more deeply on <strong>what sort of guidance would feel helpful yet still approachable</strong>. We incorporated more activities with users, such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li>Product walkthroughs, learning how people respond to different aspects of the existing site</li>
                        <li>Card sorts, learning how people conceptualize tasks fitting into categories</li>
                        <li>Layout comparisons, learning how people respond to different formats on how tasks are presented</li>

                        With 8 user interviews completed, we proceeded to pull key quotes and organize them through an Affinity Map.

                        Key Takeaways
                    </h3>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        The team had been operating under the assumption that people planning ahead wanted similar things from a product as people who were managing a loss. The user interview sessions revealed some surprising and insightful insights, underscoring that these are two completely separate populations. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        Certain characteristics made the pre-planning scenario particularly unique:</p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li>
                            Unlike a scenario where someone is managing a loss (“after-loss”), there is little urgency with pre-planning. Barriers such as anxiety and fear around the subject of death as well as confusion about what actually needs to get done, combined with people’s natural laziness and a feeling like death isn’t imminent, create an <strong>easy case for procrastination</strong>. People think planning ahead for death is important, just not right now. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once people begin pre-planning with Lantern, they realize how many things there are that they've never thought about. They find the structure helpful to learn more to satisfy their curiosity, and yet, many of them <strong>look around but don't actually fill things out or check things off</strong> because:
                            <ul class="partial-width">
                                <li>They're too lazy to get their documents and accounts</li>
                                <li>It's an emotional experience to engage with all the topics</li>
                                <li>Some topics they don't really care about</li>
                                <li>There are some things they want to talk to people about, but it's hard to think about starting conversations because the topic is so taboo</li>
                                <li>They’re not sure of their answers; It's just hard to make decisions</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>People who do fill out their pre-plan don’t always think about it like they’re “preparing for death,” rather <strong>they see it as a “responsible” thing to do</strong>. It’s like “getting their ducks in a row” or “getting prepared.” Just another thing to manage as a responsible adult. </li>

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        Using the information we collected with our research summary, we created a set of personas to represent the 4 archetypes of users we observed. These archetype users emerged from their preferences with regard to 2 critical questions: 
                    </p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li>How urgent and relevant is it to the user to plan ahead?</li>
                        <li>How comfortable are they with confronting the idea of death?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        It became clear that the key audience we wanted to target was the lower-right quadrant: <strong>users who were fairly comfortable thinking about death, but did not find the planning to be urgent</strong>. We elaborated on this person and called her <strong>Adulting Amy</strong>. Her main motivation in thinking about end-of-life is to get organized and plan ahead, like a responsible adult.
