                </h2>
                <p class="partial-width">
                    A few years ago, the Biostatistics team at the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Translational
                    Research (MICHR) noticed that staff statisticians were spread out and
                    siloed across campus. They wanted a way to bring them all together, and the Applied Biostatistical
                    Science (ABS) network was born. This resource aimed to <strong>foster partnerships among
                        statisticians,
                        epidemiologists, and researchers</strong> across the university.
                </p>
                <p class="partial-width">
                    Now that the ABS Network has grown in size to over 250 members, the Biostatistics team wants to find
                    ways to further engage and serve
                    their members beyond the current offerings of in-person seminars and courses.

                        Biostatisticians.
                        We also set up interviews with administrators for the Clinical Trial Support Units across
                        campus,
                        who are the people most likely to seek out biostatistican support.

                    Our interviews revealed a deeper understanding into the Biostatistician experience under four key

                <ul class="partial-width">
                    <li><strong>Me & My Work</strong>
                        <br>Biostatisticians find their work meaningful, but feel inundated with the requests they get.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Connecting</strong>
                        <br>Biostatisticians have a desire to connect to other biostatisticians but experience internal
                        and external barriers that keep them from making the connections they seek.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Learning</strong>
                        <br>Biostatisticians have an appetite for learning more statistics, whether in a formal setting
                        or informally through asking questions to people they have access to.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The ABS Network</strong>
                        <br>Biostatisticians do not use the ABS Network website, but rather find value in the network
                        through seminars and events. They learn about ABS events primarily through emails.

                <p class="partial-width">
                    After learning about how Biostatisticians used the network and how the existing ABS Website was
                    being utilized, we uncovered opportunities for the ABS Network team to provide further support to
                    their members, such as:
                </p>
                <ul class="partial-width">
                    <li>Expand ABS events to include more topics and add more inclusivity and convenience for
                        biostatisticians in different work configurations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Start an U-M Annual Biostatistics conference to celebrate the biostatistician community and form
                        closer bonds.
                    </li>
                    <li>Create a Slack channel, or some other forum of short, just-in-time, informal communication
                        needs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Expand on or take inspiration from the IHPI group of biostatisticians, who seem to have found a
                        good structure for productive and engaging careers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Run deliberate experiments to explore digital communication mediums such as e-newsletters.
                    </li>
                    <li>Involve engaged ABS members to work towards policy change at U-M. Biostatisticians are looking
                        to create meaningful change and the ABS network is uniquely positioned to bubble deficiencies in
                        a systematic and constructive manner.

                <p class="partial-width">
                    As part of our work with the ABS Network team, we uncovered that while the website was not the
                    primary way members engaged with the network, it was <strong>the face of the network</strong> for
                    new
                    members, as well as
                    groups and institutions interested in learning more about the network.

                <p class="partial-width">
                    The original website was created to test functionality, while less attention was paid to the
                    website’s visual design. But as the network is gaining prominence and the team is starting to
                    exhibit the site to greater
                    audiences, the site’s visuals need to appear more <strong>high-quality and professional</strong>.

                <p class="partial-width">
                    As a bonus addition to this project, our team gave the website a refresh, both designing the site as
                    well as implementing it in code.
