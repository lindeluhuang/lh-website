          Client Ask
        </h2>
        <p class="partial-width">
          <strong>The Community Engagement team asked us to help them create a project that would enable academics and
            community members come together to partner in research.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          Health research has long been considered solely an academic pursuit, and itâ€™s extremely common for researchers
          to conduct their experiments without the contributions and feedback of the greater communities they study.
          This
          makes for both bad relationships and bad science.
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          Thankfully, a new research approach is starting to gain traction. Community-engaged research (CEnR) is a
          philosophy and set of research methods that <strong>aim to bring community partners into the research
            process</strong>, at any point from study design and implementation to analysis and dissemination. We set
          out to enable these connections for communities all across the state through our online platform
          <strong>Michigan Research Engaging the Academy and Community in Health (M-REACH)</strong>.

      <section id="questions">
        <h2 class="partial-width mreach-color-h2">
          Questions
        </h2>
        <p class="partial-width">
          When we embarked on this project, there were no existing products in this space, and we as designers were
          unfamiliar with the users. This left us with many
          questions such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="partial-width">
          <li><strong>How do values, perspectives, and needs differ between our key users?</strong><br>
            In many ways this platform is a double-sided marketplace, with academics on one side and
            community members on another. We didn't know
            much about either group when we first started, so we knew we had to begin our process with deep user
            research to uncover these groups' true wants and needs.
          </li>
          <li><strong>What current barriers exist to partnership?</strong><br>
            In the world of Community Engaged Research, each partnership is hard-fought. We needed to learn what kept
            more
            people from forming partnerships in order to identify the opportunities for our product to help the process
            along.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Where can a technology solution make the most impact in this space?</strong><br>
            Community engagement is largely an in-person, people-focused endeavor. Many community members do
            not rely as heavily on technologies, especially for making connections, so we knew it would take a lot of
            experimentation to see where a tech solution would be both useful and appropriate.
          </li>
          <li><strong>How do we bring engage users at every step along the way?</strong><br>
            We highly prioritize involving our users at every stage of the design process, but this user group in
            particular was hard to mobilize. Academics are extremely busy and community members are distrustful of
            medical institutions, so the
            challenge to get user feedback was a logistical one as well as a relational one.
          </li>
          <li><strong>How do we make sure voices are represented equitably?</strong><br>
            There is a long and gruesome history of medical researchers taking advantage of people of color, and this
            legacy still affects the power dynamics in play today. We knew our solution would not be of
            good or right unless we fully acknowledged and accounted for these disparities.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Approach and Process
        </h2>
        <p class="partial-width">
          <strong>Our highest priority was to keep users at the center of whatever solution we built, designing what
            they need instead of what we want. </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          This
          meant beginning the process with user research, inviting users to give feedback after every round of design,
          and using both qualitative and quantitative user data to measure success and determine our next directions.

          Challenges and Solutions
        </h2>
        <p class="partial-width">
          Each phase of the design process came with its own unique set of challenges and we had to be humble, flexible,
          and scrappy to find solutions to overcome them.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="phase1">
        <h3 class="partial-width">
          Phase 1: Strategize
        </h3>
        <h4 class="partial-width">
          Challenge: How can we consider both academics and community voices in an equitable
          way?
        </h4>
        <p class="partial-width">
          When we worked with our clients to get more specific on who exactly the users were, we realized the power
          dynamic between the groups was more complicated than we imagined.
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          To figure out how to do right by both sides
          we engaged in a lot of background research around discrimination in healthcare and health research, working
          closely with the Community Engagement team to <strong>identify best practices</strong> on how to involve
          people from
          the community in a way that was dignifying and empowering.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section id="phase2">
        <h3 class="partial-width">
          Phase 2: Discover
        </h3>
        <h4 class="partial-width">
          Challenge: How do we meaningfully learn what these very different groups of users actually want and
          need?
        </h4>
        <p class="partial-width">
          Choosing the right design methods to learn what users actually want is the crux of every design project since
          it creates the foundation to build on top of for the rest of the process.
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          To tackle this challenge for our very different sets of users, we incorporated the standard empathy interviews
          but also went a step further. We looked outside the standard UX research toolkit and <strong>explored
            participatory
            design methods</strong>, culminating in a co-creation session with 70 users. This helped us understand our
          users beyond
          what they say or what they do, getting deeper into their wants by looking at what they make.
        </p>
        <h4 class="partial-width">
          Challenge: How can we create a reliable pipeline for user testing participants?
        </h4>
        <p class="partial-width">
          Recruiting real users for feedback is usually not an easy task, and we knew that it may be harder than usual
          for us to get access to our users since academics are extremely busy and community members are hesitant to
          participate in hospital-related projects.
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          In order to build our pipeline of participants, we knew we had to start early. In the first set of meetings
          where we identified our key users, we immediately reached out to partners to help us make
          connections with them.
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          We also <strong>took advantage of existing user events</strong>, such as the Community Engagement annual
          retreat, to tell
          people about our project and get their buy-in so they would be more willing to get involved.
        </p>

      <section id="phase3">
        <h3 class="partial-width">
          Phases 3-5: Prototype
        </h3>
        <h4 class="partial-width">
          Challenge: How do we test the boundaries of the design?
        </h4>
        <p class="partial-width">
          In the rapid prototyping cycle, each iteration aims to get you a bit more confidence to what the right design
          should be. In order to gain certainty, we need to figure out how to test the boundaries to know in what
          direction to move forward.
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          For each set of designs, we face this challenge by experimenting with a variety of possibilities for each
          feature and particularly try to feel out the edges. Instead of showing one option to users and see if they
          like it, we always make sure to <strong>present multiple options across the spectrum</strong> for each idea to
          make sure people have
          enough exposure to different options so we get richer feedback.
        </p>
        <h4 class="partial-width">
          Challenge: How do you utilize tech meaningfully, and not just for tech sake?
        </h4>
        <p class="partial-width">
          It's easy for product designers to want to design digital solutions for everything. After all, when you're a
          hammer, everything looks like a nail. But this Community-Engaged Research space is one that heavily emphasizes
          human interaction and connection, and we needed to introduce tech in a thoughtful way.
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          To address this challenge, we worked with the Community Engagement team to develop a <strong>service design
            model</strong> that
          would work in tandem with the website. By incorporating in-person human elements to the overall service
          blueprint, we made the product more robust and turned it into a more holistic service experience.
        </p>
        <h4 class="partial-width">
          Challenge: How do you know when it's good enough?
        </h4>
        <p class="partial-width">
          The hardest thing about iterative design is knowing when to stop. When do you have enough confidence from user
          testing to know you should ship the feature?
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          Tackling this challenge is part of the wonderful messiness that is design. It's tempting to user-test ideas to
          death to make sure they're exactly right, but the truth is that showing users in controlled environment like a
          feedback session has its limits. Once a feature has just enough consensus, <strong>the most useful feedback is
            seeing
            how users actually engage with the product in the real world</strong>. We strive to ship fast and be nimble
          enough to
          course-correct when needed.

          Phase 6: Launch
        </h3>
        <h4 class="partial-width">
          Challenge: How do we entice people to check out the product?
        </h4>
        <p class="partial-width">
          Ah, the age-old problem of awareness and engagement. It's not true that "if you build it they will come."
          Without a team budget for marketing or advertising, the challenge the team currently faces is sharing the product with people
          who need it.
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          In a world where trust and networks really matter, we have relied mostly on partnerships we have formed in
          both the academic and community engagement worlds to spread the word. In this phase, <strong>we plan to
            undergo a
            variety of initiatives</strong> such as creating an in-house product video to show off M-REACH's value,
          plugging into
          university communication streams, and going on (virtual) roadshows to show off the product.

          </li>
          <li><strong>Engage users in a variety of ways to get richer feedback.</strong> Especially on the front-end of
            design, look for participatory methods that incorporate not just what someone says or does but also what
            they make.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Test the boundaries of an idea space.</strong> Don't just test the most obvious option.

        <p class="partial-width">
          Throughout the process, I took stock of the more hefty lessons I learned and turned them into long-form
          essays, published on Medium as part of the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/" target="_blank">UX Collective</a> publication:
        </p>

            not an interview, it's a listening session</a>
          <br>I took a deep dive into user interviews for this project.  This essay takes a look at the user
          discovery interview, revealing the nuances of how it differs from a journalism-style interview.

          <br>This was the first time I played with quick doodles to share user research insights. In this essay I make
          a case for using using visuals, even really simple ones, to communicate ideas much more richly than through
          words alone.

          <br>We ran into many bumps as we designed our 70-person user co-creation session, and in this essay I explore
          the role of context in design and how we should have been more mindful of this key principle in designing our
          session.
