                        Problem
                    </h2>
                    <p class="partial-width">Sometimes when I’m in a particularly reflective mood, I have musings that
                        particularly strike me. I usually jot them down in my phone’s Notes app, but they’re mingled
                        there with
                        other things like my grocery list or to do’s. I wanted to keep these special thoughts around and
                        reflect
                        on from time to time, but when they were <strong>buried in my phone they got lost among the
                            noise</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="partial-width">I wanted an app I could use that wasn’t for daily to-do reminders, not for
                        accomplishing things. <strong>I wanted a simple journal of short musings and memories that
                            wouldn’t slip
                            away</strong>. Like Facebook’s On This Day feature that brings old posts to the forefront, I
                        wanted
                        an app that could bring old thoughts back to me every so often.
                    </p>
                    <p class="partial-width">I searched and searched and couldn’t find that app. So I decided to make it
                        myself.

                            <br>These apps are geared toward keeping and organizing random notes. They’re the most
                            similar to
                            what I was creating, though these apps didn’t make it easy to look back on past notes.

                        <li><strong>Reminder apps (such as

                            <br>These apps served more like to-do lists for task-based thoughts, which were not the
                            types of
                            thoughts I wanted to target. I wanted to target ponderings that weren’t necessarily
                            actionable right
                            away, but rather more interesting food-for-thought. </li>
                        <li><strong>Journaling apps (such as

                            <br>These journaling apps incorporated all different types of media (like photos and videos)
                            or
                            metrics to track (such as mood or activity). They also often organized their structure
                            around
                            getting the user to write an entry every day. My idea is to get much simpler, focusing only
                            on notes
                            without any pressure to write at specific intervals. </li>

                            <br>These apps are used for more focused writing, and were much longer and more formal than
                            of the
                            types of notes I was hoping to capture. </li>

                            <br>Sticky notes around the house and long-form journals are a convenient, low-tech way to
                            record
                            thoughts. I myself enjoy the ritual of writing things by hand, and would hope this app could
                            hopefully supplement rather than completely replace them.

                            people
                            don’t use. I want this app to focus on the more abstract thoughts people have, rather than
                            task-based to-do’s.

                            <br>Even though all these other apps store notes, most of them keep them filed away and it
                            takes
                            great effort to find old notes again. I wanted to keep the looking back portion of this app

                            productivity.
                            Instead of having a million options at your fingertips, I wanted the UI and experience to
                            feel light

                        various phone apps or emailed notes to themselves.

                        them from looking back more often, and what they do after they do look back. Finally, I showed

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        Based off the user feedback from sharing version 1, I adjusted my initial designs. Of the many
                        tweaks I
                        made, a few of my key changes are outlined below.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li><strong>Switched my perspective on reminders. </strong>
                            <br>When I showed editing an app with a reminder date, people got hung up on deciding when
                            they
                            think they’d want to see it again. This distracted from the main idea of reflecting on the
                            past, not
                            planning the future. I switched the lens on my reminder feature, emphasizing the “look back”
                            component.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Created a “Lookback” view in the app.</strong>
                            <br>While I may obsessively read my emails, I realized pretty much nobody else did the same.
                            I
                            realized I needed a way for people to look back from within the app, so I created a whole
                            “Lookback”
                            view.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set the Lookback cadence to monthly.</strong>
                            <br>People are often rushed for time, and reading past notes seemed to be more of a
                            relaxation or
                            reflection activity rather than a productive one. I decided on a monthly cadence since it
                            seemed
                            like long enough for people to not get completely sick of reminders, but also short enough
                            that the
                            lookbacks would stay engaging and interesting.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Limited amount of Lookbacks in a given month.</strong>
                            <br>People have hundreds of notes through the years. Seeing potentially dozens and dozens of
                            notes
                            at a time would be a huge turnoff to ever returning. I set an adjustable limit to make sure
                            people
                            both know there is a limit, and can adjust the limit as they see fit. </li>
                        <li><strong>Added favorites.</strong>
                            <br>People tended to go back to the same note over and over again, to add on as well as to
                            review. I
                            realized I needed a way to keep certain notes at-the-ready. I chose Favorites over a pinning
                            system
                            because the idea of favoriting something added an emotional attachment I felt was in-line
                            with the
                            app goals. </li>
                        <li><strong>Added note highlights.</strong>
                            <br>People wanted a way to pull out the most interesting or impactful part of their notes,
                            especially for the ones that got long. They wanted to make sure these sections were the ones
                            that
                            appeared on preview, as opposed to always showing the beginning of the note. I played with
                            multiple
                            formatting options but ultimately landed on highlights, to maintain the clean, minimal look
                            that
                            characterizes the app. </li>

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        After conducting my user feedback sessions with the clickable protoype of v2, as well as asking
                        designer
                        opinions about the overall look and feel, I made a variety of UX and UI tweaks to v3.
                    </p>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        Also, since I knew my next step would be to build a working prototype in Bubble, I mainly
                        <strong>focused on
                            ways to simplify</strong>. A few of my simplification strategies are outlined below.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="partial-width">
                        <li><strong>Reduce navigation complexity.</strong>
                            <br>When I first introduced Favorites and Lookback as separate views, I treated them as
                            separate
                            navigation destinations in the app. However, they are mostly different views on the same
                            data, so I
                            used a tab component to differentiate, which greatly reduced the complexity of my app.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Simplify editing features.</strong>
                            <br>I have big dreams for formatting text of a thought, but the coding complexity required
                            to
                            achieve some of the fancy edits made it prohibitive to build. I had to sacrifice some
                            features users
                            liked in order to get out a working version as quickly as possible.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Enforce more presets.</strong>
                            <br>My v2 designs featured a variety of options for setting the frequency and amount of
                            Lookbacks,
                            both in the app and over email. To reduce complexity in the Lookback logic, I made the
                            decision to
                            enforce a preset for the app (10 thoughts form this date in past months) and for emails (10
                            thoughts
                            from this month in past years) across the board.

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        To begin building a working app, I first had to whittle down the
                        list of features to release as the MVP. I combined my user feedback learnings with my
                        understanding of
                        Bubble’s features to sort out the features I wanted to prioritize.

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        The resulting feature matrix takes columns of feature categories, and splits each one up into
                        priority
                        buckets: “Need to Have,” “Good to Have,” and “Nice to Have.” I would <strong>build all of my
                            “Need to
                            Have” features for the MVP</strong> and slowly incorporate the “Good to Have” features while
                        letting
                        user feedback determine each new feature’s priority.

                    <p class="partial-width">
                        I used the <a href="https://bubble.io/" target="_blank">Bubble</a> platform to build a working
                        MVP.
                        Choosing a no-code option, as opposed to coding a
                        full web app from scratch, cut down on the time it would take to show off the product to users.
                        Since I
                        had made products in Bubble before and I was familiar with its functionality, I made the whole
                        product
                        in only a few days!
                    </p>
                    <p class="partial-width">
                        However, making this choice meant I had to give up on a few key features such as text
                        formatting, app
                        notifications, and component animation. Still, I decided the tradeoff was worth it. The
                        sacrifices did
                        not have to do with the fundamental app concept, and <strong>at this stage I mostly wanted to
                            test how
                            users would interact with the core of the app</strong>.
